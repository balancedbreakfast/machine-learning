Bayes Theorem: P(A|B) = ( P(B|A) * P(A) ) / P(B)

##ELI5 Bayes Theorem
Lets you ask a probability question in reverse given a related probability for example:

You sleep late 40% of the time.
You wake up late in the morning 30% of the time.
70% of the time you woke up late in the morning it was because you had slept late.
Bayes Theorem lets you answer: If I sleep late what are the chances I'll wake up late in the morning?

Following the above theorem: (70% * 30%) / 40% = 52.5% chance that I'll wake up late in the morning when I sleep late.
